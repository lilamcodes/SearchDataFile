"216692","17:22:55 Benjamin Lane: Location is first priority. Right now my wife commutes about 1 hour each way. Second is space with ability for the kids to come home and have a space of their own that can eventually convert to guest room or office."

The new home we want to put an offer on is located at 3612 Brandes St. Erie, PA 16509. My realtor stated that my loan estimate and pre-approval letter need to reflect the taxes at this location which is $3,400/year and I need it before 10am due to my realtor having showings all day with her other clients and someone else already put a offer in on the home so she wants us to put ours in as well first thing this morning...

I currently like the idea of buying a condo, until my boyfriend finishes school and we buy a house together. I would like the condo in my name. I am open to a house if it is in the right location! I found a condo I would like to visit, it has an open house tomorrow. I have also spoken with a realtor in the past and that is who I will continue the house hunting process with. I hope you can help me get pre approved quickly! (I am done paying for school now out of pocket so I will be able to save more very quickly and be ready very soon)

It’s absolutely move-in ready and gorgeous. Right now is a good time for me to buy because I have been renting for years now and I want to stop throwing money down the drain and building equity as I move into my 30’s. I also really like this house because the price point is great. It is around the same payment as my rent right including PMI, Homeowners insurance and taxes. Also the taxes are absurdly cheap for the area.
"
"277681","13:35:52 Michael Moreland: Good, thanks. I am retired and have lived at my current location since 1990. My wife and I have a 800 credit score. Looking at home on Lake Whitney 3000 st , lake view, $299,000, like new condition. I have approximately $120,000-$150,000 equity in my home. There is not a lot of surplus homes for sale in my community so the market is good for sales. I think I would need to move quickly on this home to buy. Doubt if they would entertain anything but outright sale. How could I purchase on a temp basis until I could sale my home? Could then refi into conventional or possibly reverse. What are my options?

"539991","14:35:07 Chelsea: We've been in our neighborhood for over 6 years and it's just perfect for us. It's very walkable, it's older as I mentioned so it's got great charm and lots of trees. We're just a block or so from the river and we've just grown very attached to the location. It's close to everything! I'm really not even sure how much to tell you we are looking for. A couple of things on that subject. I've spoken to our current landlord and he's disclosed that he'd like to sell the home we're in for around $220k. I've done a quick search of the others in the area that we've liked as well and it seems that $200k-$220k is sort of standard? Although, I'm not sure how much trust to put in those websites so I'm not sure. As a first time buyer, though, I'm not sure what kind of stipulations there are for loans that I would quality for. For example, I have the better credit between my spouse and I, but my income is a bit lower.
"
"539992","14:41:31 Chelsea: That was actually a question that I had about the process. As I mentioned my landlord told us what he'd like to sell the house for, and based on the location and his knowledge he is likely going to be able to sell it for that much. But based on the condition of the home, if the appraisal came in lower than he was looking to sell for, is that something that the mortgage lender discusses with the seller? Ideally, we will both be on the loan. However, we do not have any opposition to only one of us being on it so long as we are able to purchase a home, if it comes down to one of us having a better chance than the other at being approved, if that makes sense.

We are all just clueless on how all of this works.

I'm out of town training until October, and am looking at homes in my new location.  I'm trying to pre-qualify in case my realtor and a friend are able to find a good house for me before October.  My intention is to sell me current home, but I know I won't be able to do so before October and expect it to take a while after I complete the move.
